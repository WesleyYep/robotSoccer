Something cool.
Please run the Java program, and press start, before launching the c++ program.

Developer Notes:
Coding Convention
=================
Add some so we can all see
--------------------------
1.  Class naming, first letter of each internal word capitalized.
2.  Tabs should be tab character and not tabs with spaces replaced.
3.  if else or if else if statements should be:
<pre>
if () {
} else {
}
if () {
} else if () {
}
</pre>

Simulation currently only works if it's not connected to the c++ program, and only testForward is supported in simulation.
